Project: Pizza Sales Analysis

Project Overview

The Pizza Sales Analysis project is designed to analyse transactional sales data from a pizza store. The goal is to identify key business insights, trends, and KPIs that will help management make informed decisions related to sales, marketing, and operations.

Business Objectives
Identify overall revenue, total pizzas sold, and total number of orders.
Determine sales distribution by pizza category, size, and type.
Analyse time-based trends in sales (daily, monthly, and yearly).
Highlight best-selling and least-selling pizzas by revenue and quantity.
Understand customer purchasing behaviour through Average Order Value (AOV) and Average Pizza per Order.
Provide visualization dashboards for effective decision-making.

Data Source & Description
Dataset: pizza_sales.csv
Key fields:
order_id → Unique identifier for each order
pizza_id → Unique identifier for each pizza
pizza_name → Name of the pizza sold
quantity → Number of pizzas sold per order
total_price → Total revenue for each transaction
date, time → Order timestamp for time-based analysis
pizza_category, pizza_size → Attributes for pizza classification



Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Revenue = Sum of total_price
Total Pizzas Sold = Sum of quantity
Total Orders = Count of unique order_id
Average Order Value (AOV) = Total Revenue ÷ Total Orders
Average Pizza per Order = Total Pizzas Sold ÷ Total Orders

Analysis & Visualizations
Ingredient Analysis
The pizza business aims to understand which ingredients are most frequently used across different pizza types. By identifying the most common ingredients, the store can
